# Emerald
A small game engine project based heavily on TheCherno's Hazel Engine.
At the moment this project only serves as a platform to educate myself in application and game development.
As this project matures I plan to branch off of the tutorial platform into more 2D focused classic games engine.
Currently Emerald supports Windows and Linux, with possible support for MacOS although I have no machine to test this.
